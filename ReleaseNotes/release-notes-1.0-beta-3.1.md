This is a small patch release for 1.0 beta 3 to fix some issues. It also add some quality of life changes, particularly for controller users.

The most important change is that Lost World no longer applies to every mission while it's active! 1.0 beta 3 had a bug which meant that you faced the Lost far too often during this dark event.

## 1.0 beta 3.1 changes (from beta 3)

This is mostly a bug fix release - changes listed below.

### New Features

* The Long War camera rotation settings in the Campaign options menu now works (you don't need a separate camera mod any more, but they will still work).
* The Resistance Management screen now works with a controller:
  - D-Pad Up/Down to cycle through the list items
  - Button A opens the management screen for the selected haven
  - Right-stick click flies the Avenger to the selected haven
  - Button X on the Geoscape opens the Resistance Management screen
* The haven management screen now works with a controller
  - D-Pad Left/Right cycles through the jobs for the selected rebel
  - Bumper buttons cycle through the jobs for *all* the rebels
  - Right-stick click changes the haven adviser
  - Button Y builds a radio relay when that option is available

### Balance

* High Voltage bonus radius from +2 to +1 tiles
* Reaper's concealment is now automatically broken opening a crate on Smash and Grab missions
* Templar's Vigilance, Apotheosis, Overcharge and Mentally Awake no longer apply to the Ghost

### Bug fixes

* Fixed the High Voltage bonus radius, which wasn't giving the full bonus previously
* The Undying Loyalty and Sealed Armor dark events now apply to the LWOTC-specific ADVENT enemies, like Engineers and Sentries, making these dark events much more dangerous
* The Barrier dark event now applies to all the enemies added by LWOTC as well as the vanilla ones
* The Lost World dark event no longer applies to every mission while it's active. It behaves like the other dark events (Rapid Response, Undying Loyalty etc.) that add a sit rep to the mission.
* Fixed the localisation for a few pistol abilities that were referring to a soldier's secondary weapon instead of the pistol

We hope you enjoy the mod, and good luck commanders!
