Welcome to a new version of Long War of the Chosen!

Beta 5 will hopefully be the last of the betas and will for the most part be the same as the 1.0 release version when that finally happens.

We recommend that you should start a new campaign if upgrading from any version prior to dev build 28, but it's not critical. Existing faction soldiers will retain their old ability trees and the changes to Chosen knowledge gain may hurt more than help if you're already some way into a campaign. Players upgrading from dev build 28.2 shouldn't have any issues.

Here are some of the headline changes you may be interested in:

* Reapers are noticeably stronger than before, particularly in the early game
* The Chosen Avenger Assault should be more manageable
* Covert Actions no longer have a chance of capture
* Players should no longer be able to accidentally enable Lost and Abandoned (enabling it tends to break the campaign at some point)

That Nexus page also has a patch zip file that you can use to upgrade an existing LWOTC installation if it's version beta 4.1, dev build 27.x or dev build 28.x. The upgrade zip file should be unpacked into the *XCom2-WarOfTheChosen/XComGame/Mods* directory, overwriting the existing LWOTC and Community Highlander files.

More details on all the balance changes and bug fixes can be found below.

## Chosen

  - It can chain up to 4 times
  - Its cooldown has been reduced to 4 turns
  - It no longer has an aim malus

## Balance

### Strategy

 * Supply Extraction missions require retrieval of at least 4 crates to be a success (previously they were too easy to abuse for free mission XP)
 * Early Intel Raid missions have 1 or 2 fewer enemies than before
 * There are two new covert actions you can run:
   - Obtain a resistance MEC
   - Recruit resistance rebels
 * Disabled the Captured Soldier covert action risk completely (it was too much of a disincentive considering the soldier ranks at stake and the Intel cost required to remove the risk)
 * Covert Action ambush chance now works on a pseudo-random basis - the initial chance is now much lower (down to 5-10% from 15-20%) but it increases every time a covert action completes without being ambushed, resetting back to the initial chance once an ambush does finally proc
 * Restored the Guardian Angel resistance order (prevents ambushes on covert actions)
 * Alien Loot covert action now awards some alloys and elerium, with the quantity depending on how far into the campaign you are
 * Removed the Left Behind dark event (the one that added capture risk to all covert actions)
 * Removed the Counterintelligence Sweep dark event (the one that reduces rebel intel generation by half)
 * Rescued soldiers are now healed for a significant portion of their health to compensate for time spent captured
 * Class abilities purchased with AP when another class ability at the same rank has already been picked once again incur a cost multiplier, though a smaller one than it used to be - the aim being to discourage all AP being funnelled into the A team
 * Snap Shot and Death From Above are mutually exclusive now, because it's a brokenly strong combo that's very cheap
 * When a region is liberated, all job prohibitions due to failed mini retals are immediately cleared

### Tactical

 * Slowed down reinforcements on invasions and recruit retaliations to make these missions a little less oppressive
 * Sectopods should now use their Lightning Field ability on XCOM
 * Shieldbearers will now prioritise good shots over shielding just themselves (but shielding allies still takes precedence over all)
 * Rebels now get Stock Strike and Get Up
 * SPARKs can now trigger and benefit from Focus Fire

## Quality of life

 * Second wave options will now persist between campaigns (so now you only have to disable the tutorial once!)
 * Disabled "Enable Introduction?" alert at the campaign start so people can't accidentally enable Lost and Abandoned, bricking their campaigns
 * Added button on geoscape to access resistance management screen (contributed by Rai)
 * Added loadout button for adviser in outpost management (contributed by Rai)
 * Flashbang resistance is now visible as a passive effect on enemies that have it (Muton Centurions, Elites, Sectoid Commanders, etc. - contributed by Amnesieri)

## Bug fixes

### Strategy

 * You should no longer encounter blank soldier rewards or buggy rescued soldiers
 * You should no longer encounter Chosen at a higher level than intended for the current force level
 * Faceless rebels can no longer be recruited in a haven if the proportion of Faceless in that haven is greater than 32%
 * Chosen can no longer select uncontacted regions for the Retribution activity

### Tactical

 * The hangs that players experience with dashing-melee attacks like Fleche should be much rarer now, although not gone completely
 * Disabling the pod leader will no longer prevent the rest of the pod from scampering (this fixes a more general issue with pods not scampering if the pod leader skips their move for any reason)
 * Multi-shot abilities will no longer cause lots of lag on missions with many enemies
 * Reinforcement units spawned from the Avenger on the Avenger Defense mission should now always be controllable
 * The Dark VIP should now be correctly extracted if carried by the last soldier to evac
 * Fire Discipline now works (it did nothing before)
 * Avenger and Flush will now shred targets if the shooter has the Shredder ability
 * Impersonal Edge will no longer trigger on other units' kills
 * The Sniper Defense AI behaviour should now work, making it harder for Sharpshooters to get flanking shots on enemy units that have no sight on XCOM
 * EMP grenades now disorient robotic units as intended 
 * Rend the Mark's effect is no longer permament
 * Terrorize localization no longer incorrectly says that chance to panic is based on Templar's psi offense (it's based on will)
 * Warlock's Greatest Champion should now be properly removed from the Warlock on the death of the affected unit
 * The Purifier's flamethrower should now be using the sweep animation
 * Rend no longer works while the Templar is burning
 * Chosen can kidnap while burning
 * Removed Indomitable and Terrorize from Templar Ghost
 * Blood Trail no longer works on explosives and damage over time (DoTs like bleeding and poison)
 * Zone of Control now works and has a green ring around units with that ability
 * Arc Wave no longer grants focus on killing disoriented units
 * Arc Wave's description now shows the correct values for its damage
 * Combat Rush now triggers on kills with area-of-effect abilities
 * Abilities that apply to "unarmored" units now also work on units that have had all their armor shredded off
 * When Lightning Reflexes triggers, it no longer reduces the effect on *all units on the map* that have Lightning Reflexes
 * Lightning Reflexes will now properly have reduced effect after being procced by abilities like Hunter Protocol and the Lost Grappler's reaction attack
 * Hyper Reactive Pupils no longer procs when any unit misses, not just the one with the HRP PCS
 * Missions can no longer have two or more officers on them (this could happen before if the second officer was not part of the original squad, for example as a haven adviser or Avenger Defense reinforcement)
 * Field Commanders (max-rank officers) now get their +1 bonus to Command range
 * Officer abilities that apply buffs to units in range now apply to haven advisers
 * Units using weapons other than a sniper rifle can now overwatch after using Double Tap
 * Locked On now persists across turns and no longer disappears when the shooter performs a non-offensive action (this is back to the Long War 2 behavior); it now only works for the primary weapon
 * Jammer charges are no longer restored on reloading a save file

## Modding

 * Mods can patch multi-shot abilities that are implemented like Rapid Fire/Chain Shot by adding them to the `MULTI_SHOT_ABILITIES` config array in *XComLW_Overhaul.ini*, fixing a performance issue that causes big pauses on large missions
